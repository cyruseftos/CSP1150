# Assignment 1: Balance Tracker

Implements a “Balance Tracker” program in which the user enters an initial balance value and can then add or subtract
amounts from this value. The program keeps track of these transactions, and allow the user to see the current
balance as well as information about the transactions that have been made.

# Assignment 2: QuoteMaster

This assignment is combination of my understanding and ability to apply the programming concepts covered throughout
the unit. The concepts that were covered in the second half of the unit build upon the fundamentals that were covered in
the first half of the unit.

## Overview

admin.py, a CLI program that allows the user to add, list, search, view and delete details of quotes, and stores the
data in a text file. It uses the “json” module to write data to the text file in JSON format and to read the JSON data
from the file.

quotemaster.py, a GUI program that uses the data from the “data.txt” text file to quiz the user about
the authors of the quotes. Quotemaster uses the “tkinter” module to create the GUI.
